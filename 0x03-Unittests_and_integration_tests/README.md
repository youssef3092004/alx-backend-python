## Introduction
In this project, we will explore how to write and run unittests and integration tests using Python's built-in `unittest` module.

## Unittests
Unittests are used to test individual units of code to ensure they work as expected. A unit can be a function, method, or class.

## Integration Tests
Integration tests are used to test the interaction between different units of code to ensure they work together as expected.

## Setup
To set up the testing environment, follow these steps:
1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
4. Install necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
python -m unittest discover
```
